You notice that the supplies won't last forever so you you turn on the radio to hopefully hear something that could help. You catch a broadcast saying to go to the local military base that is a refugee camp with protection and supplies.

1. Leave the house to the military base
2. I've seen to many movies to know the base is destroyed. I'll stay here for a longer time
